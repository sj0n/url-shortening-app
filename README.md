## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io)

<br>

### What I learned
Instead of the typical web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the web application was developed using Svelte. With Svelte, I break down parts of the web into Svelte Components. I chose Svelte instead of other frameworks because frameworks such as React and Vue feels different than the usual code style that I am used to without using frameworks. Svelte approach feels straightforward and it is pretty easy to learn.
